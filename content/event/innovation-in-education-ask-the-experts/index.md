summary:
abstract: If there’s one thing higher education IT departments have learned in the past few years, it’s the need to be ready for anything. During the pandemic, institutions have been forced to shift to remote work and learning on a dime, incorporate countless ed tech tools and figure out new digital workflows, all the while facing unprecedented cybersecurity risks, retention challenges and other concerns. The key to navigating all of those hurdles is having the infrastructure and data analytics in place to adapt to change both today and in the future.
