abstract: >-
  Artificial intelligence and machine learning have become critical for
  organizations seeking to leverage business value from their data. The need for
  schools to prep students to be technologists well-versed in these tools is in
  more demand than ever. However, institutions building data science courses are
  often stymied by the high variability of needs across teachers, faculty, and
  students. Instructors and students often struggle with configurations of
  rapidly evolving AI/ML tooling. 


  The ideal solution is a flexible, customizable alternative to individually configured data science tooling. This solution must provide the leading open-source tools to reflect industry usage and a cloud service approach to allow faculty and researchers to spend more time teaching and less time debugging laptops. It should also provide a consistent, reliable, and fair environment for all and, ideally, allow connecting from a browser to lab material. This webinar presents just such a solution.
