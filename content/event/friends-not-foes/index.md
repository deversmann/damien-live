summary: "Why Institutions and Corporations Need True
  Partnership to Transform"
abstract: >-
  Digital transformation requires changes in technology and a technology market that addresses the specific challenges of higher education.  In transactional buyer/seller relationships where institutions are unwilling to share their challenges and corporations are unwilling to listen to the market needs, square-peg/round-hole implementations occur. To digitally transform higher education, institutions and corporations need to be willing and able to come together and co-create the solutions of tomorrow based on the challenges of today.


  In this session, EDUCAUSE Showcase Series corporate sponsors will join institutions to discuss true partnership, collaboration, and how to co-create solutions together. Get ready to challenge your thinking of how institutions and corporations interact and dream of a future where both groups can solve big issues â€“ together.
